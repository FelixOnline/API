## Docs
Docs are generated using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) with the markdown files being stored in the sections folder. The Perl script to generate html from the files is in the markdown folder although I will include a bash script to auto generate them. To add a new section to the docs you need to add the name of the .md file (also the section name and id) to the section array in index.php in the right order.
