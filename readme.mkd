# Felix Online API + Docs

This converts Felix Online Core models into JSON endpoints through use of some simple mapping and model manipulation code

## Installation

This must be installed as a subdirectory of the main site. Currently a completely isolated API install is not supported.

Once this is done, simply set up a config file in inc as appropriate, following the template as instruction.
